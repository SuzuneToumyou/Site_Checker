# Site_Checker
This Python script monitors a specified website at set intervals (default is every 6 hours) and displays a popup notification if the website content has changed.

## Features
Automated monitoring: The script runs in the background and checks for updates every 6 hours.
Popup notifications: Alerts you when a change is detected.
Simple configuration: Just set the website URL and monitoring interval.

## Notes
Ensure you have PyQt5 installed for the popup notifications to work.
The script compares the websiteâ€™s content over time. If the structure of the site changes frequently, consider refining the detection method.
Requires an active internet connection to fetch updates.
